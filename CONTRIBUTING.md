# Contributing to txt2png

Pull requests are welcome with any bug fixes or new features! Please ensure the feature is general-purpose for a wide user base. The pull request should be descriptive about what you are trying to achieve. Please write tests and lint the code, and update the test harness and README if necessary.

Feel free to open an issue if there is a problem, but as this isn't my job, I can't guarantee a _speedy_ reply.
